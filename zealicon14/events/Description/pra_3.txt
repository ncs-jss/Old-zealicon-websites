- Like an architect, we must make a "blue print" drawing of our RubeGoldberg machine listing all twenty steps with the proper names of the different simple
machines.
-we must build and mount our apparatus on a wooden or solid platform.Our project must fit through the door.
-we must demonstrate our device using the proper terms to identify the different simple machines. Then we will physically demonstrate our device to the
class.
