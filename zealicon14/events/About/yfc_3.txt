Collage making is the event which is associated with YFAC for a long time. In this event we decide upon a theme reflecting any of the social stigma prevalent in the society and the students participating in the event makes collages on the particular theme. Through this event we get to know the mindset of the students towards the society and also make them aware of various aspects of our society. This event has been a major success and has witnessed very high participation for many years now.
