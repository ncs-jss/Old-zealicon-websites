This event is a themed event, wherein the participating students would be given a theme ( Social domain) and they would have to capture photos through any device (mobile,camera etc) and give us the softcopyâ€™s along with a photo description. Now the rule is that the photo is to be captured within the campus so as to avoid any cheating. The best aspect of this event is that the students would make use of their innovative mind to capture a particular theme and describe that theme in a 30 word sentence. The winners would be decided based on the quality of the description and the clarity of the theme.
