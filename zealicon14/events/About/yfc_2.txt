This is also a very famous event of YFAC running for many years now. In this event we hide certain YFAC logos in the college campus and the students have to find those logos based on the clues which they get as they find each of the flag. The clues are based on knowledge on various aspects of the society and the students have to use their minds to crack those clues and actually find the result. Through this event we get to know about the knowledge of the students in social domain (NGOâ€™s etc) in an interesting manner.
