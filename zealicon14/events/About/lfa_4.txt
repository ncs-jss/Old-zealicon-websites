“If passion drives you, let reason hold the reins”
The podium is where the battle of words begins. Inspire others with your ideas and get   inspired from theirs. Question the obvious and conventional and suggest the alternative. The assertions would be strong and so shall be the arguments but only those who shall endure the heat until the end would emerge victorious.
"It is better to debate a question without settling it than to settle a question without debating it."
